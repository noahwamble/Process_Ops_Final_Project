# Process Operations Final Project
By: Noah Wamble and Pete Giannini

This project will look at the optimal scheduling of a craft brewery that makes several different products with different product specifications. 
The objective will be to maximize the profit of the craft brewery. This optimization problem is based off of the framework developed by Kondili in 1991 and uses a State Task Network.
